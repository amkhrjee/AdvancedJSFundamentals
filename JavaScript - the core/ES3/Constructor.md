# Constructor

Besides creation of objects by specified pattern, a _constructor_ function does another useful thing â€” it _automatically sets a prototype object_ for newly created objects. This prototype object is stored in the `ConstructorFunction.prototype` property.

E.g., we may rewite previous example with `b` and `c` objects using a constructor function.
Thus, the role of the object `a` (a prototype) `Foo.prototype` plays:

```js
//a constructor function
function Foo(y) {
  /* which may create objects by specified pattern: they have after creation own "y" property */
  this.y = y;
}

/*also "Foo.prototype" stores reference
to the prototype of newly created objects,
so we may use it to define shared/inherited
properties or methods, so the same as in
previous example we have: */

//inherited property "x"
Foo.prototype.x = 10;

//and inherited method "calculate"
Foo.prototype.calculate = function (z) {
  return this.x + this.y + z;
};

/* now we create our b and c objects
using "pattern" foo */
var b = new Foo(20);
var c = new Foo(30);

//call the inherited method
b.calculate(30); //60
c.calculate(40); //80

//let's show that we reference
//properties we expect

console.log(
  b.__proto__ === Foo.prototype, //true
  c.__proto__ === Foo.prototype, //true
  // also "Foo.prototype" automatically creates
  // a special property "constructor", which is a
  // reference to the constructor function itself;
  // instances "b" and "c" may found it via
  // delegation and use to check their constructor

  b.constructor === Foo, //true
  c.constructor === Foo, //true
  Foo.prototype.constructor === Foo, //true

  b.calculate === b.__proto__.calculate, //true
  b.__proto__.calculate === Foo.prototype.calculate //true
);
```

This code maybe presented as the following relationship:

> `__proto__` is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc.
> `prototype` is the object that is used to build `__proto__` when you create an object with new:

> new Foo().__proto__ === Foo.prototype;
> new Foo().prototype === undefined;

This figure again shows that every object has a prototype. Constructor function `Foo` also has its own `__proto__` which is `Function.prototype`, and which in turn also references via its `__proto__` property again to the `Object.prototype`. Thus, repeat, `Foo.prototype` is just an explicit property of Foo which refers to the prototype of b and c objects.

Formally if to consider the concept of _classification_, a combination of the constructor function and the prototype object may be called as a "class".

> **NOTICE** In ES6 the concept of a class is standardized and is implented exactly as a syntactic sugar on top of the constructor functions as described above. From this viewpoint prototype chains become as an implementation detail of the class-based inheritance:

> ```js
> // ES6
> class Foo {
>   constructor(name) {
>     this._name = name;
>   }
>
>   getName() {
>     return this._name;
>   }
> }
> class Bar extends Foo {
>   getName() {
>     return super.getName() + " Doe";
>   }
> }
> var bar = new Bar("John");
> console.log(bar.getName()); // John Doe
> ```
