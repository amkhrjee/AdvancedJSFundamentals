## What is a Callback Function

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

JavaScript is a synchronous and single-threaded language but with the help of callbacks, we can do async stuff with JS!

## Blocking the Main Thread üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The call stack is also known as the **_Main Thread_**.

As there is only one call stack or main thread in JS, if a part of a program takes a lot of time to execute, it _blocks_ the main thread for the rest of the program.

This is called **_Blocking of Main Thread_** and we should avoid doing this.

Asynchronous functions help us avoid this problem and `setTimeout()` is a prime example of that.
