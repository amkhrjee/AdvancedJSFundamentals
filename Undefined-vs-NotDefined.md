## `Undefined`

If a variable is `undefined` that means memory has been allocated to that variable and the `undefined` is used as a placeholder value for that variable.

## `Not defined`

This means the variable does not exist in the memory space at all. And hence the JS engine thows a `Reference Error` as it cannot reference any variable in the call stack.

### "JavaScript is a loosly typed languange" - what does that mean?

This means JS engines do not assign any particular datatype to a variable when it allocates memory to the varibale.
