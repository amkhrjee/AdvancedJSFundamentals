# âš¡Closure

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).

In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

Yes, it's that simple, huh ðŸ˜²

> ðŸ’¡ When you return a function from another function, that returned function still holds reference to its original lexical scope (the original parent function)
